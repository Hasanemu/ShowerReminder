                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Talha is one of the most genuine and kind-hearted people I know. Over time, he confided in me about something deeply personal—his sexuality. Talha is gay. This isn’t something he chose or was influenced into; it’s simply who he is. From a young age, he began to notice that he was attracted to other boys, even though he didn’t have the words for it at the time. For years, he kept this part of himself hidden, unsure how the world around him—especially in a society that often silences such topics—would react. But what’s remarkable is how calmly and clearly he understands his identity. He doesn’t view it as something to be ashamed of, but as something to be embraced.
                </p>
                
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                   Living in Pakistan, Talha has faced quiet struggles that most people will never see. He has dealt with isolation, judgment, and the fear of being misunderstood. Yet despite all this, he carries himself with immense courage. He’s never tried to make his sexuality his whole identity, but he also refuses to live in fear of it. What’s most admirable is how open-hearted he remains—willing to have conversations, answer questions, and calmly correct the misconceptions people might have. He doesn’t want to be seen as “different” or “wrong.” He just wants to be seen as human.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                   Talha’s story matters because it challenges the silence around LGBTQ+ people in our culture. There are so many others like him who feel invisible or alone. By sharing his truth, Talha isn’t just standing up for himself—he’s helping others feel seen too. I’m proud to call him my friend, and I hope that his courage can inspire more understanding, empathy, and openness. At the end of the day, we all just want to be accepted for who we truly are.
                </p>
                
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                   There were small moments throughout Talha’s childhood that slowly helped him understand his sexuality. While other boys around him talked about crushes on girls or admired female celebrities, Talha realized his feelings didn’t align with theirs. He found himself quietly drawn to male characters in movies or felt a sense of admiration and emotional connection toward certain classmates—feelings he couldn’t explain at the time. In school, he’d sometimes wonder why he didn’t relate to the excitement his peers felt over girls, and why instead he felt nervous around certain boys. It wasn’t about physicality—it was about a deeper sense of connection and comfort. These early scenarios weren’t loud or dramatic; they were quiet realizations that, over time, helped him piece together an important truth about himself.
